## 🎯 Complete Workflow Implementation

### Step 1: Data Collection & Abnormality Detection
- ✅ Collects static train schedules and live data
- ✅ Detects abnormalities (delays >10min, stoppages >5min)
- ✅ Identifies trains requiring AI intervention

### Step 2: AI Solution Processing
- ✅ Asks control room for reason (with 2-minute timeout)
- ✅ Uses ML model to infer reason when control room doesn't respond
- ✅ Generates multiple "ways" (route change, track change, train replacement)
- ✅ Uses CP-SAT optimization to select best solutions

### Step 3: Schedule Optimization
- ✅ Optimizes train schedules for maximum throughput
- ✅ Runs what-if scenario analysis
- ✅ Provides recommendations for operational improvements

### Step 4: Controller Dashboard
- ✅ Displays AI solutions with priority scores
- ✅ Allows accept/reject decisions
- ✅ Updates static schedules when solutions accepted
- ✅ Notifies railway systems of implemented solutions

### Step 5: ML Learning
- ✅ Learns from controller feedback (accept/reject)
- ✅ Improves future solution recommendations
- ✅ Updates model parameters based on preferences

### Step 6: Flag Management
- ✅ Prevents continuous abnormality detection loops
- ✅ Implements solution expiry system
- ✅ Manages applied solution states
